# UofCMarketplace

Our team proposed to create a full stack website where University of Calgary students post products they want to sell such as textbooks or clothing. Usually, students have to go through a hassle to meet random people across the city when they are trying to sell their textbooks. The objective for our project is to create a platform for UCalgary students so that they can easily and safely buy/sell items online. Our application provides a safe experience for UCalgary students to connect and exchange goods through creating posts on the application. Posts can only be created by UCalgary students after signing up for an account and every post consists of a description of a product or a description of what the student needs. These posts are all collectively posted on the main page where everyone can see the posts and the email of the creator so that they can get in contact with them if they are interested.
